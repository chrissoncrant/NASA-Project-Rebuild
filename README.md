# NASA-Project-Rebuild
Rebuilding NASA project from ZTM course

## Intention
My intention for this project is to rebuild a project from the Zero to Mastery's Complete NodeJS Developer course. I will be doing this in order to practice what I have learned in order to aid in my retention of the information and skills. 

While going through the project from scratch I will be doing my best to document the journey and the thought process in this README.
